NameFlow



NameFlow involves three main components

1. ENS


2. Worldcoin

We use World ID as a vital security layer—users must complete a one-time human verification before creating any domain or subdomain. This step blocks bots and fraudulent accounts, ensuring every identity on our platform is genuine, and fostering trust and integrity in our ecosystem.

3. CELO Mainnet

Our platform leverages Celo Mainnet as the authoritative registry for all ENS domains and subdomains. Every domain or subdomain is registered directly on Celo and linked to a user’s address, providing a complete, transparent record of their digital assets. With our integrated AI agent, users can effortlessly view and manage all their registered domains in one centralized location. This seamless integration not only simplifies domain management but also enhances security and trust in our ecosystem by ensuring all records are securely maintained on a robust, decentralized network.
